##Setup project

1. Check out the project
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/BioPhoton/ng-drupal-services-tests-with-ng.git [project name]

  Then cd into the folder and check out the dev branch

2. Setup node_modules  
  In the ckecked out branch there is a package.json file   
  which contains all required node modules required for the gulp tasks.
  ```bash
  $ npm install
  ```
3. Load bower lib's  
  As all the thrid party libs are not in the repository we have to load them over bower  
  ```bash
  $ bower update   
  ```  
  Open app.config.js
  ```javascript
	//drupal services configurations
	DrupalApiConstant.drupal_instance = 'http://www.your.domain/'; 
	DrupalApiConstant.api_endpoint += 'v1/'; // "api/v1/"

  ```  
  
  Now you are ready to test it. Run following command:    
  ```bash
  $ gulp webserver  
  ```
